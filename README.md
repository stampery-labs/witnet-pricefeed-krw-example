# witnet-pricefeed-krw-example
This is an example of a decentralized price-feed retrieving the price of the KRW with respect to BTC and USD. The smart contract utilizes the Witnet DON to retrieve the data from 8 different sources in both cases. These sources are:

KRW/BTC:
 - coinone
 - blockchain
 - coinzeus
 - korbit
 - bithumb
 - coindesk
 - coinpaprika
 - billboard

USD/KRW:
 - rateExchange
 - transferwise
 - freecurrencyrates
 - finder
 - reuters
 - freeForexApi
 - fxEmpire
 - currencyCal
 

The **aggregation phase** includes a filter in which values deviated more than 1.5 standard deviations from the average are discarded. After that, the average of the values reported by the **sources** is taken.

The **tally phase** includes a filter in which values deviated more than 1 standard deviation from the average are discarded. After that, the average of the values reported by the **witnesses** is taken.
